# ImageToText
Google has released their machine learning APIs to perform tasks such as extracting text from images. This API is provided by Google, and allows to extract text from images. For detailed reference read this documentation available from Google https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/quickstart

I have used this library to make curl call using PHP Scripting and extracts text from image. CURL requests send image making a RESTFul API call and returns JSON format of text.
